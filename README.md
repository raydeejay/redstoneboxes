### Redstone Boxes

This is a Minecraft mod that allows you to create a personal
transportation device, known as a Redstone Box, which has absolutely
nothing to do with other boxes that might move through space and/or
time, because it's red. Obviously.

This mod is currently in alpha, and at the moment only written for a
single player game.

For Minecraft 1.10.2.
